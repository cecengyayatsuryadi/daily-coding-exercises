# Daily Coding Exercises

Welcome to the Daily Coding Exercises repository!

## About

This repository is dedicated to my daily coding practice. Each day, I work on various coding exercises to enhance my programming skills, explore different algorithms and data structures, and strengthen my problem-solving abilities.

## Structure

The repository is organized chronologically, with exercises grouped by date. Each exercise is stored in its respective folder, named in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" (e.g., "2023-01-01"). Inside each exercise folder, you will find the code files related to that particular day's exercise.

## Contents

The exercises cover a wide range of programming languages and topics, including algorithms, data structures, string manipulation, sorting, searching, and more. Each exercise is accompanied by a problem statement or a description of the task at hand.

Feel free to explore the repository, examine the code, and even try solving the exercises yourself. I hope these exercises can serve as a valuable resource for learning and practicing programming concepts.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily reflects my personal coding exercises, I welcome contributions from the community. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional exercises that you think would be beneficial, please feel free to submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!

## Resources

I have also included a curated list of resources in the `resources.md` file. These resources consist of helpful articles, tutorials, books, and online platforms that have been instrumental in my coding journey. Feel free to check them out and expand your knowledge further.
